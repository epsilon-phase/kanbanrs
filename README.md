# Features so far

* Fuzzy searching

  You can search tasks using fuzzy matching over multiple fields.
* "Lightweight"

  The document I use to track development only allocates 17 mb to the heap
* Convenient for dogfooding its own development
* Tags

  Sometimes title and description fields are just not enough

* Queue view

  Task trackers that focus on kanban tends to allow for choice paralysis(especially if you're procrastinating
  like I often do), if you use priorities and the task dependency system then this will allow you
  to see the most important unblocked tasks first.

* Focus View

  Focus on related tasks.

* Categories
* Category based styling - Allows styling the presentation of tasks based on what they are.
* Sorting

# It might even do

* Some semblance of being accessible.

  I haven't devoted as much time as is necessary to checking this, Egui is supposedly screenreader
  compatible but I haven't tried it.

# Upcoming features

* Category view, because focusing on a single category is nice sometimes.

* Tree view

  Show the entire dependency graph of your tasks. This is at least 20% "because I could and it sounded cool"
* Some sort of preferences
* Priorities
